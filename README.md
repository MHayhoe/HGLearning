# HGLearning

This is a repository for hypergraph learning in PyTorch. The models herein allow for training of stable and transferable hypergraph neural networks using graph expansions. These models and the transferability guarantees will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.

This is a work in progress, built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/alelab-upenn/graph-neural-networks">AleLab GNN package</a>.
